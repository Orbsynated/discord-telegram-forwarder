# discord-telegram-forwarder
Forwards all message in discord to telegram, with filter options.

## Disclaimer

The use of a user account interacting with Discord's API, opposed to that of a bot, is implicitly against Discord's terms of service. Therefore use of this program may result in the **termination of your account**. I take no responsibility in the event this may occur. However, as I have no knowledge of this occuring and that the program interacts to a very minimal extent with the API, the percieved risk is low.

## TODO

1. Implement forwarding messages to multiple telegram bots.
2. Implement forwarding messages from multiple discord users/bots.
3. Implement sending private messages from telegram to discord.
